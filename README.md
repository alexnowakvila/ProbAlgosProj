## TO DO

### Description of Algorithms and Complexity Analysis
Summarize the different existing algorithms and applicability of each one. Explain the applicability of each
algo depending on the situation. State the theoretical guarantees.

### Analysis of theoretical guarantees
Understand the proofs of the theoretical garantees. Summarize the main steps and ideas of the most imortant results.
### Experiments
Implement the main probabilistic algorithms in Matlab. Identify interesting problems where these problems can be useful.
Test theoretical guarantees experimentally to check how loose the bounds are. Test the main algorithms.
- Stage A: Randomized Range Finder + Error Estimation
- Stage B: Direct SVD
- Stage A: Structure Random Matrix
- Stage B: Row extraction
