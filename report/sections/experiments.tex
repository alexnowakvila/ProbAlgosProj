\section*{Experiments}
In this section, we briefly present our experiments on some of the 
algorithms presented at the previous sections. Two sets of experiments are presented.

The first tests are on powers
of random gaussian matrices of different sizes. The goal of this set of numerics
is to check the performance of the algorithms and make sure they are working
as expected. We also analyze the sharpness of the bounds dictated by the theory.
In particular, the error estimation procedure which was motivated by 
Lemma \ref{thm:aposteriori}.

The second set of experiments is ...
