\section*{Introduction}

Matrix factorization is listed as one of the most influential set
of techniques during the 20th century ~\cite{dongarra2000guest}, among
the Fast Fourier Transform, MCMC sampling methods and others.
As Stewart ~\cite{stewart2000decompositional} argues, the principle of the
decompositional approach aims to construct computational platforms from
which a variety of problems can be solved.

Although the decompositional approach to matrix computational remains
fundamental, nowadays in the era of big data most of the classical algorithms
are inadequate to tackle most of the problems.

\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
\mtx{A} &\approx& \mtx{B} & \mtx{C},\\
m\times n && m \times k & k\times n.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
